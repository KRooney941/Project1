Project title:

Vet Management App

Project Description:

A simple web app using Flask, HTML, SQLite, and CSS. The app allows users to add and edit birds and vets to the practice and allows users to see all vets and birds currently with the project. It also displays a table of all birds in the practice and allows users to see a more detailed view of individual birds.

There are several things I wanted to add to the project, but ran out of time. I wanted to add the ability for users to add owners to the vet and assign birds to those owners. I also would have liked to add check-in/check-out times as well as appointments and payment prices.

How to Install and Run the Project:

First you will have to clone the repo using "github git@github.com:KRooney941/Project1.gitTo" in the terminal. Then to run the project you have to have to have sqlite3, flask and python3 installed. Then seed the database using “sqlite3 db/vet_management.db < db/vet_management.sql” in the terminal, then run python3 console.py also in the terminal. Then enter “flask run” in the terminal.
